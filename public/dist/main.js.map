Mark Acosta. I am a relentless seeker of new information. I started coding in high school in South Jersey and loved it but my real passion became apparent during my time at Rowan Unversity.I studied JAVA, but I never felt quenched until I decided to become a Web Developer. Why? Because I like quick results and competition. Nothing excites me more than becoming an expert at my craft. I hear it so much that sometimes I actually believe my name is \"You need to take a break\". My other passions include drumming, art and fitness. I have experience in many languages but I specialize in JavaScript. My favorite languages/frameworks/libraries include JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, React, Node/Express and my personal favorite, Angular 2.0. I\\'ve developed many substantial projects including Razu , Vu API and  Planet Planner. This portfolio was also built in ReactJS and was intended to show my flexibility in design and development. A couple of these projects were developed during my time as Lead Web Developer for Razu Inc but I was involved with some other cool jobs. I taught Python to students internationally under a Google-funded Lego NXT educational program. Although its not JavaScript , I enjoy teaching code as much, if not more, than I enjoy coding itself. I intend to code until my fingers stop complying but I really want to lead teams in development and become a mentor/teacher for those interested. For this reason, my absolute favorite position was with Razu Inc. At Razu,I oriented new developers with the Mean stack using Angular 2 as well as coded a vast majority of the project to build a social network for artists to collaborate on projects and promote themselves.'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\tReact.createElement(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'span',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{ id: 'moon' },\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReact.createElement('img', { id: 'bug-lord', src: '/assets/mark-flip.png' }),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReact.createElement('img', { id: 'hill', src: '/assets/hill4.png' })\n\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}]);\n\t\n\t\treturn About;\n\t}(React.Component);\n\n/***/ },\n/* 197 */\n/*!**********************************************!*\\\n  !*** ./public/scripts/components/contact.js ***!\n  \\**********************************************/\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t\tvalue: true\n\t});\n\texports.Contact = undefined;\n\t\n\tvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\t\n\tvar _velocity = __webpack_require__(/*! ./../plugins/velocity.js */ 192);\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\tfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) { if (!self) { throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"); } return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\") ? call : self; }\n\t\n\tfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) { if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) { throw new TypeError(\"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" + typeof superClass); } subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, { constructor: { value: subClass, enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true } }); if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ?

Mark Acosta. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI am a relentless seeker of new information. I started coding in high school in South Jersey and loved it but my real passion became apparent during my time at Rowan Unversity.I studied JAVA, but I never felt quenched until I decided to become a Web Developer. Why? Because I like quick results and competition. Nothing excites me more than becoming an expert at my craft. I hear it so much that sometimes I actually believe my name is \"You need to take a break\". \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy other passions include drumming, art and fitness.    \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI have experience in many languages but I specialize in JavaScript. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy favorite languages/frameworks/libraries include JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, React, Node/Express and my personal favorite, Angular 2.0.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI've developed many substantial projects including Razu , Vu API and  Planet Planner.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis portfolio was also built in ReactJS and was intended to show my flexibility in design and development.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA couple of these projects were developed during my time as Lead Web Developer for Razu Inc but I was involved with some other cool jobs. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI taught Python to students internationally under a Google-funded Lego NXT educational program.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough its not JavaScript , I enjoy teaching code as much, if not more, than I enjoy coding itself.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI intend to code until my fingers stop complying but I really want to lead teams in development and become a mentor/teacher for those interested. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor this reason, my absolute favorite position was with Razu Inc.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt Razu,I oriented new developers with the Mean stack using Angular 2 as well as coded a vast majority of the project to build a social network for artists to collaborate on projects and promote themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</span>\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"moon\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<img id=\"bug-lord\" src=\"/assets/mark-flip.png\"></img>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<img id=\"hill\" src=\"/assets/hill4.png\"></img>\r\n\t\t\t\t</span>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t)\r\n\t}\r\n}\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./public/scripts/components/about.js\n **/","import {anim} from './../plugins/velocity.js';\r\n\r\nexport class Contact extends React.Component{\r\n\tconstructor(props){\r\n\t\tsuper(props);\r\n\r\n\t\tthis.state = {\r\n\t\t\tvalid: true,\r\n\t\t\terror: ''\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tvalidateForm() {\r\n\t    var x = $('#from').val();\r\n\r\n\t    var atpos = x.indexOf(\"@\");\r\n\t    var dotpos = x.lastIndexOf(\".\");\r\n\t    if (atpos<1 || dotpos<atpos+2 || dotpos+2>=x.length) {\r\n\t    \t$('#error').removeClass('success');\r\n\t    \t$('#error').addClass('error');\t    \t\r\n\t    \tthis.setState({error: 'Email much?'})\r\n\t\t\tthis.setTimeError();\r\n\r\n\t    \treturn false;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    var y = $('#subject').val();\r\n\t    if (y == null || y == \"\") {\r\n\t    \t$('#error').removeClass('success');\r\n\t    \t$('#error').addClass('error');\t    \t\r\n\t    \tthis.setState({error: 'Identify yourself stranger!'})\r\n\t\t\tthis.setTimeError();\r\n\r\n\t    \treturn false;\r\n\t    }\r\n\r\n\t    var z = $('#text').val();\r\n\t    if (z == null || z == \"\") {\r\n\t    \t$('#error').removeClass('success');\r\n\t    \t$('#error').addClass('error');\t    \t\r\n\t    \tthis.setState({error: 'Cat got your tongue?'})\r\n\t\t\tthis.setTimeError();\r\n\r\n\t    \treturn false;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t    return true;\r\n\t}\t\r\n\r\n\tkeys(){\r\n\t    $('#from').on('keyup', (e) => {\r\n\t    \tthis.checkKey(e)});\r\n\t    $('#subject').on('keyup', (e) => {\r\n\t    \tthis.checkKey(e)});\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tcheckKey(e){\r\n\t\t var code = e.keyCode || e.which;\r\n\t\t if(code == 13) { //Enter keycode\r\n\t\t   this.validateForm();\r\n\t\t }\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tcomponentDidMount(){\r\n\r\n\t\tthis.keys();\r\n\t\tanim($('#contact').children('h1'), 7, 1900)\r\n\r\n\t\t$('#email').on('click', () => {\r\n\t\t\tthis.sendEmail();\r\n\t\t})\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\ttimeError(){\r\n    \t$('#error').removeClass('success');\r\n    \t$('#error').removeClass('error');\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tsetTimeError(){\r\n\t\tsetTimeout(() => {\r\n\t\t\t$('#error').addClass('retract')\t\t\r\n\t\t}, 2300)\r\n\r\n\t\tsetTimeout(() => {\r\n\t    \t$('#error').removeClass('success');\r\n    \t\t$('#error').removeClass('error');\t\t\r\n    \t\t$('#error').removeClass('load');\t\t\r\n    \t\t$('#error').removeClass('retract');\t\t\r\n\t\t}, 3000)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tsendEmail(){\r\n\t\tif(this.validateForm()){\r\n\t\t\tthis.timeError();\r\n\t    \tthis.setState({error: 'Sending ...
